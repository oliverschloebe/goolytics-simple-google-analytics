A simple Google Analytics solution that works without slowing down your WordPress installation.

== Description ==

I needed to have a clean and small plugin that offers data protection options for users running sites in Germany.
Unlike many other Google Analytics plugins it offers to anonymize IPs as it's neccessary for german users in order to have the GA code respect german data protection rules.

**Features:**

* Simple and guided setup
* Lightweight and fast
* Anonymize IP (recommended for german users to respect german/european data protection rules according to DSGVO/GDPR)
* Usercentrics support (recommended for german users to respect german/european data protection rules according to DSGVO/GDPR)
